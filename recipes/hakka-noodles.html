        </h1>
        <p>Hakka noodles are Indian-Chinese style noodles made with unleavened refined wheat flour. These are boiled al dente and then stir-fried in a Chinese wok with oil, vegetables & soya sauce. The term "Hakka noodles" can refer to both the final dish and the type of noodles used.</p>
