# odin-recipes
In this Project, I will be Building a Webpage for Listing Recipes. 
I will be covering all the Initial Basic Lessons that I have learned about HTML, & 
Shipping this Project will show my learnings in Action.
This will be Fun.

I have learned about
- Headers
- Paragraphs
- Break points
- Image tag and its properties like,
    src attribute, tweaking the height and width of an image and
    providing alt attribute for alternative text.
- anchor tag and href attribute 
    for adding links to other websites 
    and links of web pages inside the current website.
- ordered lists and unordered lists

The Odin Project definitely helped me to Gain these Basic Knowledge about HTML with the help of this Hands-on Project, It made me to think and Build the Webpages, rather than just passively learning the material and forgetting it later on.
